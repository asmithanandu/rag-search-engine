# rag-search-engine
Conversational RAG system with LangChain, Pinecone, and Streamlit.
📚 RAG-Powered Search Engine
🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based search engine using LangChain, OpenAI, FAISS, and Streamlit.
Instead of relying only on a model’s memory, this app retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers — making responses accurate, context-aware, and reliable.

🎯 Key Features

🔍 Semantic Search → Retrieve relevant documents using FAISS vector database.

🤖 RAG Pipeline → Combine retrieval with OpenAI’s language model for context-grounded answers.

💻 Interactive Web App → User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

⚡ Scalable → Can be extended to larger datasets and custom domains.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

LangChain – Orchestrating the RAG pipeline

OpenAI API – Large language model for generation

FAISS – Vector similarity search

Streamlit – Frontend web app
